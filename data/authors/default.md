## Hi 👋, I'm Hiep from Viet Nam 🇻🇳

It's 2023, and there're 10 years since the first time I write my first code, and that's an amazing feeling.

Then, I worked for NTTdata for 5 years in a Team leader position. We developed and delivered many projects from over the world. That's a time I learned a lot of experience from my colleagues who are my friends till now. 🫶🫶

Currently, I'm a full-stack software engineer at a global company.
I work mainly on Front-end side with **Typescript**, **React**, **Angular**, **Node**, **Nextjs**, and Refine. But I still love developing and solving my problems with JS stack.

I also worked on some side projects to get extra money after my full-time work.

That helped me and my family get money over the Covid-19 period. Now, it's a new normal in Viet Nam, we are open to all countries, and my wife is just back to work. We're getting money together, not much but enough for my two girls.

And I think it's time to back job I love.

## Why this blog

I also like LEAN Startup methodology, and I had some side projects with my friends. In 2021 and 2022, we spent time verifying our ideas and making plans to find investments. I worked as a **UI/UX designer**, using **Figma** for discussion and making decisions with the team for each idea.

Unfortunately, they all failed. I think that's fine for us, the road to success is not easy and we just started. I don't know when we can restart because we all have family and many other things need to do, not only startup.

I see my weakness after the failed startups. I need to open my mind to the finance field and also keep my passion by solving my problem with JS. And, I know on that road, I'm not alone because of you.

**Thank you to visit my blog and I hope you enjoy my journey**. ❤️❤️
